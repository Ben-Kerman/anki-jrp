# Installing MeCab

If you're not on Windows you'll need to install MeCab yourself.

## macOS

MeCab is available through [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mecab)
and [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/mecab/).

### Troubleshooting

#### Executable not found

If trying to use the add-on's syntax generator results in `Mecab error:
executable not found` you'll need to manually set the path to your MeCab
executable:

1. Determine the location of the executable by running `which mecab` in the
   terminal.  
   If that command doesn't return a path try looking for a file named `mecab`
   in `/opt/homebrew/bin/` (Homebrew) or `/opt/local/bin/` (MacPorts).
2. Enter the full path including the final `mecab` into `MeCab executable path`
   in the add-on's preferences (_Tools_ â†’ _JRP Add-on Preferences..._) and
   uncheck `Use system-wide MeCab executable`.

#### Missing `mecabrc`

If you get an error like `Mecab error: invalid line: param.cpp(69) [ifs]
no such file or directory: /path/to/mecabrc`, run `touch /path/to/mecabrc` to
create the file in question, where the path is whatever was reported in the
error message.

Please report any macOS-related issues that aren't mentioned here. Since I don't
own any macOS devices I can't test the add-on on macOS myself.

## Linux

Your distro might have a MeCab package, for example:

- [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=mecab)
- Arch (AUR): [mecab](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mecab),
  [mecab-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mecab-git)

If you can't find anything, compile MeCab yourself by following the instructions
below.

### Requirements

- A C++ compiler. Ideally g++ which, if it isn't installed already, should be
  available in a package called `gcc`, `g++`, or similar on most distros. Check
  if it works by running `g++ --version`.
- `libiconv`. Probably already present as part of glibc.
- `git`, for cloning the repo. You can also skip step 1 below by using the
  source tarball linked here instead: https://taku910.github.io/mecab/#download

### Compile & Install

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/taku910/mecab.git`
2. cd into the `mecab` directory in the repo. It should contain a file
   called `configure`.
3. Run this command:  
   ```./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --libexecdir=/usr/lib --with-charset=utf-8```  
   For some distros the prefix and directories might be different.
4. If `configure` finished without errors, run `make` (and ensure it succeeds).
5. Create a temporary target directory.
6. Run `make DESTDIR="<tgt dir>" install`, where `<tgt dir>` is the absolute
   path of the directory you just made.
7. Copy or move `<tgt dir>/usr/bin/mecab` and `<tgt dir>/usr/lib/libmecab.so.2`
   to a new directory. Create an empty file named `mecabrc` in the same
   directory.
8. In the add-on's preferences menu, uncheck _Use system-wide MeCab executable_
   and set _MeCab executable path_ to where you put the `mecab` executable in
   the previous step.

Alternative to step 5-8 you could also create and install a custom package, in
which case you can leave the add-on settings on their default values.
